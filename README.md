# MULTI STEP FORM
### A frontend mentor challenge.

##*Tools Used In Building This Projecy*##
- Styled Components (For Styling)
- React (VITE)
- FIREBASE (Backend as a service for cloud storage and user authentication)
- Redux (For Global state management)

##*Some Improvements I Think I Should Have Implemented*##
- Other than declaring the string `"monthly" and "yearly"`, i should have stored it in a CONST, to avoid silly bugs.
- In The Styling Also, I think i should have created a mixin for the media query.
